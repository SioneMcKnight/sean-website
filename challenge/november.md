# System76 Challenge

Happy November, System76 peeps!

>I am planning on presenting a challenge about once a month. You have the month
to complete the challenge, and **may be on a team up to three people** total.

>Think of realistic solutions, but don't be afraid to get creative! Price of
implementation is not an issue so long as it's within the realm of possibility
for a high-end product.

This challenge is **due November 30**, and the winner gets a [prize](#prize)!

## November: The Two-Lightswitch Problem!

You've probably seen it: one room or hallway with overhead lights and two
lightswitches that control the lights. You flip one switch up and the lights
come on, but now the other switch is down; they never end up being completely in
sync with the state of the lights.

1. How could you design a solution to this problem?

2. What are some challenges your solution would need to overcome?

3. What other solutions did you consider, and why did you reject them?

4. Anything else you'd like to share.


## Criteria

I will choose a winning solution based on:

1. How well it's thought out, and
2. How realistic/possible it is technically.

Be sure to share your idea in as much detail as needed!


## Prize

The best solution will be chosen on **November 30**, so be sure to have yours in
by then! The winning solution's team will receive **one dozen cookies** of their
choice from [Flours & Chocolate][fc], or an equivalent value of gift cards to
[ThinkGeek][tg] (winner's choice).
