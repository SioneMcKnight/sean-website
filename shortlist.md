# Cassidy&rsquo;s Shortlist


## A few things I&rsquo;d love

The idea of a shortlist is that it&rsquo;s a small number of things I&rsquo;d
absolutely love to get. You can use it as a surefire way to get me something
I&rsquo;ll love, or as inspiration for getting me something else.

## LEGO

I maintain a LEGO wishlist via [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames).
It&rsquo;s kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a
general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome!


## A more traditional wishlist&hellip;

Check out [amzn.com/w/43YXVLE92YAT](https://amzn.com/w/43YXVLE92YAT) for a more
traditional, sprawling wishlist. It's generally kept up to date. If you&rsquo;re
looking there, be sure to check not only the main wish list, but the Funko POP
list.
