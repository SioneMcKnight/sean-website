# Cassidy's Shortlist


## A few things I'd love

The idea of a shortlist is that it's a small number of things I'd absolutely
love to get. You can use it as a surefire way to get me something I'll love, or
as inspiration for getting me something else.

If multiple colors/options are listed, they're in descending preference order,
but all listed are totally fine.

* [Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2](http://www.microcenter.com/product/465935/Raspberry_Pi_Camera_Module_V2?src=raspberrypi)
  **$30**

* [Jaybird X3 Wireless Headphones](https://jaybirdsport.com/en-us/x3-bluetooth-headphones.html)
  **$129** or sometimes cheaper from other retailers - Roadrash (preferred),
  Blackout, or Platinum

* [Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini) ~~$49~~
  **$29** for a limited time - Coral (preferred), Charcoal, or Chalk

* [Horizon: Zero Dawn](http://gamestop.com/product/ps4/games/horizon-zero-dawn/129080)
  for PS4 **$40–60** - New or used physical copy, or digital code/PS Store
  credit. **Complete Edition** is coming out soon for **$50** with the DLC
  on-disc, which would also be rad.

  **$150**

## Stuff I Always Enjoy

I don't have specific items picked out here, but I always love receiving a
variety of these things. Pick something you think I'll like!

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/2g-6mm-filter)
  **$5–20** - 2g/6mm, single- or double-flared are fine!

* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://threadless.com) **$10–30** - Men's Large


## LEGO

I maintain a LEGO wishlist via [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames).
It's kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general
rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome!


## A more traditional wishlist&hellip;

Check out [amzn.com/w/43YXVLE92YAT](https://amzn.com/w/43YXVLE92YAT) for a more
traditional, sprawling wishlist. It's generally kept up to date. If you're
looking there, be sure to check not only the main wish list, but the Funko POP
list.
