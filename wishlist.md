# Cassidy's Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. It is
up to date as of {{ site.time | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.


## Shortlist

An ever-updated small number (3â€“7) of things I'd absolutely love to get. You can use it as a surefire way to get me something I'll love, or as inspiration for getting me something else.

If multiple colors/options are listed, they're in descending preference order, but all listed are totally fine.

* Good-sounding Bluetooth earbuds **~$35â€“150** - I don't have a specific pair picked out, but I like isolating in-ears (usually with silicone tips), I like bass, and I don't love the "neckbuds" or collar style. Something well-reviewed that's not too bulky would be wonderful. A cord between the buds is completely cool (they don't have to be totally individually wireless). [Jaybird X3](https://jaybirdsport.com/en-us/x3-bluetooth-headphones.html) are the best I've heard of, but I've also heard good things about [VAVA MOOV 28](https://www.vava.com/audiovisual-earphones/VA-BH009-2E2CFF6692E5).

* [Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2](http://www.microcenter.com/product/465935/Raspberry_Pi_Camera_Module_V2?src=raspberrypi) **$30**

* [Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition](https://www.gamestop.com/ps4/games/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition/156207) for PS4 **$45â€“50** - New or used physical copy, or digital code/PS Store credit.

* [Philips Hue White Starter Kit](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-starter-kit-e26/46677472009) **~$60â€“100** depending on retailer - 4 bulbs and bridge

* [Moment Lenses](https://www.shopmoment.com/shop/categories/all/devices/pixel) **$90** - New Superfish or New Macro

* [Peak Design Cuff](https://www.peakdesign.com/cuff) camera strap **$30** - Ash color. _Also avaialble at Best Buy, B&H Photo, and probably other camera places._

* [Wemo Mini Smart Plug](https://www.belkin.com/us/F7C063-Belkin/p/P-F7C063) **$30** - A bunch of these. ðŸ˜‰


## Stuff I Always Enjoy

I don't have specific items picked out here, but I always love receiving a variety of these things. Pick something you think I'll like!

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/2g-6mm-filter) **~$5â€“20** - 2g/6mm, single- or double-flared are fine! Hot Topic also usually has fun branded ones like Star Wars, DC Comics, Disney, etc.

* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://threadless.com) **~$10â€“30** - Men's Large

* Short-sleeve tri-blend tees **~$9-20** - Men's Large. Oatmeal, black, gray, or any bright/saturated colors. Crew or v-neck. Generally I like bright colors, plain or simple patterns, and buttonless/pocket-less. Old Navy is a good bet, but basically any place with men's clothes works!

* Gift Cards **any amount** - I shop at all of these places and would always appreciate a gift card.

  * [PlayStation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/psn-cards/) for games
  * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/giftcards/) for apps, movies, and games
  * Micro Center (only available in-store) for Raspberry Pi and gadget stuff
  * [GameStop/ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/gift-cards) for games and geek stuff
  * [LEGO Store](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Give-Gift-Card) for LEGOs, obviously
  * [Target](https://www.target.com/c/target-giftcards/all-occasions/-/N-5xsxtZ5rxa0) for whatever
  * [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/gift-cards/cat09000.c?id=cat09000#/) for gadgets
  * [Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/customerService/info.do?cid=35433) for fashion
  * [Caribou Coffee](https://shared.caribouperks.com/giftcard/) for coffeeeee
  * [Sprouts](https://www.sprouts.com/giftcards) for the best gummy bears on Earth
  
* Board/Card/Party Games **~$10â€“50** - I love simple and fun games to play with friends, like Exploding Kittens and Fluxx (which I have). Ideas:
  * Little Drop of Poison (hard to find)
  * Codenames
  * Liar's Dice (homemade set would be rad)


## LEGO

I maintain a LEGO wishlist via [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames). It's kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome!


## Experiences

Instead of getting me _stuff_, you can gift me with one of these experiences!

* Regal Cinemas movie tickets (date night!)
* Denver museum or zoo tickets


## Causes

Instead of giving to me directly, you can always give to one of these causes on my behalf. I'm passionate about each one and they all could use monetary support.

* [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) _Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation._
* [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) _A worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all software users._
* [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/donate/) _Helping create a free software computing platform for the general public that is designed to be elegant, efficient, and easy to use._
* [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) _Closing the gender gap in tech, one girl at a time._


## Amazon

I dislike Amazon since they're extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652). So if you can, please purchase any items here somewhere other than Amazon.
