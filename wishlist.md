# Cassidy's Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. It is
up to date.

## Shortlist

An ever-updated small number (3–7) of things I'd absolutely love to get. You can
use it as a surefire way to get me something I'll love, or as inspiration for
getting me something else.

If multiple colors/options are listed, they're in descending preference order,
but all listed are totally fine.

* [Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2](http://www.microcenter.com/product/465935/Raspberry_Pi_Camera_Module_V2?src=raspberrypi)
  **$30**

* [Jaybird X3 Wireless Headphones](https://jaybirdsport.com/en-us/x3-bluetooth-headphones.html)
  **$129** or sometimes cheaper from other retailers - Roadrash (preferred),
  Blackout, or Platinum

* [Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini) ~~$49~~
  **$29** for a limited time - Coral (preferred), Charcoal, or Chalk

* [Horizon: Zero Dawn](http://gamestop.com/product/ps4/games/horizon-zero-dawn/129080)
  for PS4 **$40–60** - New or used physical copy, or digital code/PS Store
  credit. **Complete Edition** is coming out soon for **$50** with the DLC
  on-disc, which would also be rad.

* [Philips Hue White Starter Kit](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-starter-kit-e26/46677472009)
  **$60–100** depending on retailer - 4 bulbs and bridge

* [Moment Photo Case for Google Pixel](https://www.shopmoment.com/shop/photo-case/pixel/black)
  **$30** - Black is preferred

* [Moment Lenses](https://www.shopmoment.com/shop/categories/all/devices/pixel)
  **$100** each - New Wide, New Tele, New Superfish, and New Macro are all
  interesting to me, in that order.


## Stuff I Always Enjoy

I don't have specific items picked out here, but I always love receiving a
variety of these things. Pick something you think I'll like!

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/2g-6mm-filter)
  **$5–20** - 2g/6mm, single- or double-flared are fine! Hot Topic also usually
  has fun branded ones like Star Wars, DC Comics, Disney, etc.

* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://threadless.com) **$10–30** - Men's Large

* Short-sleeve tri-blend tees **$9-20** - Men's Large. Oatmeal, black, gray, or
  any bright/saturated colors. Crew or v-neck. Generally I like plain or simple
  patterns, and buttonless/pocket-less. Old Navy is a good bet, but basically
  any place with men's clothes works!

* Gift Cards **any amount** - I shop at all of these places and would always
  appreciate a gift card.

  * PlayStation Network
  * Google Play
  * Micro Center
  * GameStop/ThinkGeek
  * LEGO Store
  * Target
  * Best Buy
  * Old Navy
  * Caribou Coffee


## LEGO

I maintain a LEGO wishlist via [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames).
It's kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general
rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome!


## Amazon wishlist&hellip;

Check out [amzn.com/w/{{ site.amazon }}](https://amzn.com/w/{{ site.amazon }}) for a more
traditional, sprawling wishlist. It's generally kept up to date. If you're
looking there, be sure to check not only the main wish list, but the Funko POP
list.
