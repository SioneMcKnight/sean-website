# Cassidy's Wishlist

This is my canonical birthday, Christmas, and any-other-time wish list. It is
up to date.

## Shortlist

An ever-updated small number (3–7) of things I'd absolutely love to get. You can
use it as a surefire way to get me something I'll love, or as inspiration for
getting me something else.

If multiple colors/options are listed, they're in descending preference order,
but all listed are totally fine.

* [Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2](http://www.microcenter.com/product/465935/Raspberry_Pi_Camera_Module_V2?src=raspberrypi)
  **$30**

* [Jaybird X3 Wireless Headphones](https://jaybirdsport.com/en-us/x3-bluetooth-headphones.html)
  **$129** or sometimes cheaper from other retailers - Roadrash (preferred),
  Blackout, or Platinum

* [Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini) ~~$49~~
  **$29** through December - Coral (preferred), Charcoal, or Chalk

* [Horizon: Zero Dawn](http://gamestop.com/product/ps4/games/horizon-zero-dawn/129080)
  for PS4 **$40–60** - New or used physical copy, or digital code/PS Store
  credit. **Complete Edition** is coming out soon for **$50** with the DLC
  on-disc, which would also be rad.

* [Philips Hue White Starter Kit](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-starter-kit-e26/46677472009)
  **$60–100** depending on retailer - 4 bulbs and bridge

* [Moment Photo Case for Google Pixel](https://www.shopmoment.com/shop/photo-case/pixel/black)
  ~~$30~~ **$24** through 11/30 - Black is preferred

* [Moment Lenses](https://www.shopmoment.com/shop/categories/all/devices/pixel)
  ~~$100~~ **$80** each through 11/30 - New Wide, New Tele, New Superfish, and New Macro are all
  interesting to me, in that order.


## Stuff I Always Enjoy

I don't have specific items picked out here, but I always love receiving a
variety of these things. Pick something you think I'll like!

* [Fun Gauges/Plugs](https://arcticbuffalo.com/collections/2g-6mm-filter)
  **$5–20** - 2g/6mm, single- or double-flared are fine! Hot Topic also usually
  has fun branded ones like Star Wars, DC Comics, Disney, etc.

* [Threadless Tees and Tanks](https://threadless.com) **$10–30** - Men's Large

* Short-sleeve tri-blend tees **$9-20** - Men's Large. Oatmeal, black, gray, or
  any bright/saturated colors. Crew or v-neck. Generally I like plain or simple
  patterns, and buttonless/pocket-less. Old Navy is a good bet, but basically
  any place with men's clothes works!

* Gift Cards **any amount** - I shop at all of these places and would always
  appreciate a gift card.

  * [PlayStation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/psn-cards/) for games
  * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/giftcards/) for apps, movies, and games
  * Micro Center (only available in-store) for Raspberry Pi and gadget stuff
  * [GameStop/ThinkGeek](https://www.gamestop.com/gift-cards) for games and geek stuff
  * [LEGO Store](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Give-Gift-Card) for LEGOs, obviously
  * [Target](https://www.target.com/c/target-giftcards/all-occasions/-/N-5xsxtZ5rxa0) for whatever
  * [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/gift-cards/cat09000.c?id=cat09000#/) for gadgets
  * [Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/customerService/info.do?cid=35433) for fashion
  * [Caribou Coffee](https://shared.caribouperks.com/giftcard/) for coffeeeee
  * [Sprouts](https://www.sprouts.com/giftcards) for the best gummy bears on Earth


## LEGO

I maintain a LEGO wishlist via [Brickset](http://brickset.com/sets/wantedby-cassidyjames).
It's kept up to date, especially around Christmas and my birthday. As a general
rule, duplicates are fine and all Star Wars ships are awesome!


## Causes

Instead of getting me stuff, you can always give to one of these causes on my behalf. I'm passionate about each one and they all could use monetary support.

* [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) _Defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation._
* [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) _A worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all software users._
* [GNOME Foundation](https://www.gnome.org/support-gnome/donate/) _Helping create a free software computing platform for the general public that is designed to be elegant, efficient, and easy to use._
* [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) _Closing the gender gap in tech, one girl at a time._

## Amazon wishlist&hellip;

I dislike Amazon since they're extremely [anti-competitive](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox)
and [awful to their workers](https://gizmodo.com/reminder-amazon-treats-its-employees-like-shit-1792642652),
but alas, it seems everyone wants an Amazon wishlist. If you can find the same
items elsewhere, please purchase them somewhere other than Amazon.
