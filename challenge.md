# System76 Challenge

Hey System76 peeps!

I am planning on presenting a challenge about once a month. You have the month
to complete the challenge, and may be on a team up to three people total.

Think of realistic solutions, but don't be afraid to get creative! Price of
implementation is not an issue so long as it's within the realm of possibility
for a high-end product.

## October Challenge: Dishwashers!

1. After-market or DIY indicators for dishwashers (like the thumbs-up magnet on
   ours) are fairly common; as a dishwasher manufacturer, how could you design a
   dishwasher that eliminated the need for a third-party solution?

2. What are the most difficult challenges your solution would need to overcome?

3. What other solutions did you consider, and why did you reject them?

4. Anything else you'd like to share.


## Criteria

I will choose a winning solution based on:

1. How well it's thought out, and
2. How realistic/possible it is technically.

Be sure to share your idea in as much detail as needed!


## Prize

The best solution will be chosen on **October 31**, so be sure to have yours in
by then! The winning solution's team will receive **one dozen cookies** of their
choice from [Flours & Chocolate][fc], or an equivalent value of gift cards to
[ThinkGeek][tg] (winner's choice).
