# Shortlist

Log in to create your own shortlist or to view details on other shortlists.

## 1. Create

Write down the things you most want. You're limited to seven items, so choose wisely.

## 2. Share

Share your unique link with friends. If they log in, they can see what's been purchased and mark items as purchased themselves. Purchased items are never shared with you or anyone who's not logged in (no spoilers!).

## 3. Update

Mark an item as received if someone gets it for you (or you just get antsy and get it for yourself!), and it will be removed from the list.
