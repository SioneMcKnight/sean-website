# GamePi

GamePi is a retro gaming console I make, based on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/).

## Install RetroPie

Due to software licenses, GamePi cannot be distributed with emulation software. However, installing it is easy.


### Get RetroPie

Visit the [RetroPie website](https://retropie.org.uk/) and download the latest version of RetroPie for your GamePi. The itty bitty GamePi Zero uses the “Raspberry Pi 0/1” version, while the larger, more powerful GamePi 64 uses the “Raspberry Pi 2/3” version.

### Get Etcher

Next, you have to get the RetroPie software onto your microSD card. [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) is a way to safely do just that.

[Download Etcher Now](https://etcher.io/)


### Flash the SD card

1. Open the Etcher app you downloaded in the previous step.

2. Press the **Select image** button and choose the downloaded RetroPie file.

3. Connect your microSD card to your computer.

    _You may need to use the provided microSD to SD adapter and/or a USB SD card reader if your computer does not have a built-in SD card slot. Etcher should auto-select the newly detected microSD card as the drive; if not, press **Select drive** and choose the microSD card._

4. Press the **Flash!** button and wait for the RetroPie image to be flashed to the SD card.

5. When Etcher is done, remove the microSD card and insert it into the GamePi.


## Configure RetroPie

Since the software cannot be distributed with GamePi, there are a few optimization steps to get the most of it.

To get started, connect your GamePi to an HDMI display and power. It should automatically start up. Be patient, it takes a few minutes the first time.


### Controller

1. Once the GamePi has started up, connect your USB controller.

2. Hold a button down to configure the controller.

3. Press the corresponding buttons when prompted on the screen.

    _If your controller is missing a certain button, i.e. Right and Left Triggers, hold down any button to skip that one._

4. You should be able to navigate the GamePi with the controller. If not, you can always connect a USB keyboard as a backup.


### Games

GamePi doesn't come with any games, but you can play ROM files you own from several classic game consoles. Of course it's your responsibility to make sure you own the rights to use any ROMs. [RetroPie's docs](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Transferring-Roms/) go into a bit more detail about ROMs and how to transfer them to your GamePi.
